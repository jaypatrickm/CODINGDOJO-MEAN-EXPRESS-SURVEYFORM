//Steps to accomplish this
//setup express: require files and invoke 
//can use a json package to install multiple node mods: body-parse, ejs, path?
//setup port where server will listen for http requests
//setup get routes for the root ('/'), which is where the form will show first, and post which will probably show the results
//then have to setup the ejs/view files to show these pages.
//the users will see root page first, which will have a get request that will show a view of the survey form
//the server is listening for these kinds of requests
//when the user is done with the form, they will submit the form
//this signals a post request and we will respond with the post request view page
